# How LlamaPay works

Hereâ€™s how it works for both payers and payees:

For Payers to use LlamaPay as a payer, start by inputting the payee's information. Specify the payee by entering their wallet address (e.g., 0x...), and provide a name or role for reference, such as "Alice - Designer". Next, enter the payment details, specifying the amount (e.g., 4000 USDC) and the frequency of the payment (e.g., monthly). Once you have entered these details, initiate the payment stream to start automatically sending payments over time.

To ensure continuous payments, it's important to keep your balance topped up. If you forget to top up your balance, LlamaPay offers an option to borrow funds to maintain the stream, preventing any interruptions in payment.

LlamaPay is designed to be cost-effective, with deploying a stream being 3.2-3.7 times cheaper than other services in terms of gas fees. Additionally, LlamaPay is available on all major Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains.

For Payees For payees, the process is straightforward. Start by connecting your wallet to LlamaPay. Once connected, you can claim your stream and withdraw your funds at any time. Payments are streamed in real-time, allowing you continuous access to your funds. This means you can withdraw the accrued amount whenever you need it, providing flexibility and convenience.

LlamaPay also minimizes precision errors by operating with 20 decimals internally, ensuring high accuracy in transactions. This real-time streaming of payments ensures that payees have continuous access to their funds without having to wait for scheduled payout dates.
