# Pricing

LlamaPay for outgoing payments is completely free with no fees at all, and will remain free forever.

What's more, LlamaPay contracts are not upgradeable and they don't even have an owner/admin, so we can't add fees even if we wanted to.

The payments gateway charges a 0%-1% fee on volume, for more information check [this](../payments-gateway/fees.md).
