# Withdrawals

### Withdrawals that anyone can trigger

LlamaPay allows anyone to trigger withdrawals if a payee decides to use an address that belongs to a centralized exchange (CEX) or uses a wallet that cannot make Ethereum calls.&#x20;

They can just set a CEX address and have someone else trigger withdrawals or trigger themselves using another wallet.

Payers can also trigger withdrawals for their payees by using the withdraw all button.
