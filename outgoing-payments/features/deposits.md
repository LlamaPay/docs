# Deposits

### Problem

Sablier requires you to pick a duration for each stream and deposit all the money needed for the stream at the start. This doesn't work for salaries as the length is indeterminate.

This system requires you to keep making new streams as the old ones die and you have to provide and lock up a large amount of capital if you choose a long duration.

### Solution

We create streams of indefinite duration and tokens can just be siphoned out of a pool. This makes it possible for streams to be topped up in a single transaction and you just need to provide money that's needed to maintain these streams.
