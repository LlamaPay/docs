# Pricing

LlamaPay for outgoing payments, which includes salaries, vesting and scheduled transfers, is completely free with no fees at all, and will remain free forever. These contracts are not upgradeable and don't even have an owner/admin, so they will always remain free and that can't be changed.

For LlamaPay's payment gateway, the fees are the following:

* For subscriptions: 1% of total amount paid by users. This fee is only charged when a payment is made, if a user just deposits no fee is paid.
* For direct payments: 0 fees on stablecoin payments and a 0.5% fee on payments from other tokens where a swap is needed.
